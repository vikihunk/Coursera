Hello, I am Bikash. I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity professional. 
I am working as a Cybersecurity professional involved in device security, while also taking care of security in transit and at rest.
My work involves identification and analysis of potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities of the device of interest. This ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets of the device.
The work also involves creating a strong security posture. 

With these skills I believe I can take care of device security and its interaction with external systems by defining a strong identity of the device.
